### Experiment 1 â€” Creating Threads (Passenger Arrivals)

In this first experiment, I explore the basics of Java threading:

- **Creating threads** using `Runnable` and `Thread`
- **Naming threads** for clearer debugging
- **Starting threads** with `start()`
- **Joining threads** so the main thread waits until workers finish

**Scenario:**  
Passengers (threads) arrive at the airport and are processed concurrently.  
The control tower (main thread) waits until all passengers are finished before closing the process.
