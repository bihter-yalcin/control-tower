## Experiment 1 â€” Creating Threads (Passenger Arrivals)

In this first experiment, I explore the basics of Java threading:

- **Creating threads** using `Runnable` and `Thread`
- **Naming threads** for clearer debugging
- **Starting threads** with `start()`
- **Joining threads** so the main thread waits until workers finish

**Scenario:**  
Passengers (threads) arrive at the airport and are processed concurrently.  
The control tower (main thread) waits until all passengers are finished before closing the process.

## Experiment 2 â€” Thread Termination (Gate Shutdown)

In this experiment, I explore **how to stop threads cleanly**:

### ðŸ…° Graceful Shutdown
- Uses a `volatile running` flag and `interrupt()` together.
- Worker thread continuously processes passengers until the control tower signals closure.
- Demonstrates that:
    - `running=false` â†’ prevents further loop iterations,
    - `interrupt()` â†’ wakes the thread if it is blocked (e.g., during `sleep`).
- **Outcome:** worker finishes ongoing work and exits in a controlled manner.

### ðŸ…± Executor Shutdown (GateTask + ExecutorService)
- Multiple short-lived `GateTask` jobs are submitted to a fixed thread pool.
- `shutdown()` â†’ no new tasks, but existing ones finish.
- `awaitTermination()` â†’ waits for tasks to complete.
- `shutdownNow()` â†’ interrupts running tasks and cancels queued ones.
- **Outcome:** shows the difference between **graceful** and **forceful** termination.

## Experiment 3 â€” Joint Threads (Pushback Checklist)

In this experiment, I use `Thread.join()` to coordinate multiple tasks and observe the effect of parallelism.

### ðŸ…° Catering (1 vs 2 attendants)
We process N catering trolleys in two modes:

- **One attendant (serial):**  
  Start each thread and immediately `join()` â†’ no overlap.

- **Two attendants (parallel):**  
  Start all threads, then `join()` them all â†’ overlap reduces total time.

**Outcome:** Parallel execution lowers total time (not strictly half, but clearly improved).

### ðŸ…± Pushback Checklist (3 parallel tasks)
Start three tasks in parallel:
- Catering (~1500 ms)
- Fueling (~3000 ms)
- Boarding (~2000 ms)

Main thread calls `join()` on all three before allowing pushback.

**Outcome:** Total preparation time â‰ˆ the longest task (Fueling). This demonstrates the *critical path* idea.
