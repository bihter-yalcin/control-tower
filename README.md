### Experiment 1 â€” Creating Threads (Passenger Arrivals)

In this first experiment, I explore the basics of Java threading:

- **Creating threads** using `Runnable` and `Thread`
- **Naming threads** for clearer debugging
- **Starting threads** with `start()`
- **Joining threads** so the main thread waits until workers finish

**Scenario:**  
Passengers (threads) arrive at the airport and are processed concurrently.  
The control tower (main thread) waits until all passengers are finished before closing the process.

### Experiment 2 â€” Thread Termination (Gate Shutdown)

In this experiment, I explore **how to stop threads cleanly**:

#### ðŸ…° Graceful Shutdown 
- Uses a `volatile running` flag and `interrupt()` together.
- Worker thread continuously processes passengers until the control tower signals closure.
- Demonstrates that:
    - `running=false` â†’ prevents further loop iterations,
    - `interrupt()` â†’ wakes the thread if it is blocked (e.g., during `sleep`).
- Outcome: worker finishes ongoing work and exits in a controlled manner.

#### ðŸ…± Executor Shutdown (GateTask + ExecutorService)
- Multiple short-lived `GateTask` jobs are submitted to a fixed thread pool.
- `shutdown()` â†’ no new tasks, but existing ones finish.
- `awaitTermination()` â†’ waits for tasks to complete.
- `shutdownNow()` â†’ interrupts running tasks and cancels queued ones.
- Outcome: shows the difference between **graceful** and **forceful** termination.
